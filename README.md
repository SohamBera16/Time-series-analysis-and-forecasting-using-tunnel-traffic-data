# Time-series-forecasting-for-tunnel-traffic
Tunnel Traffic is a time series describing the number of vehicles traveling through the Baregg Tunnel in Switzerland each day from November 2003 to November 2005. Here, I try to explore various components in the time series like trends and seasonality and predict on out of sample data using Linear Regression model.

## Steps of the project:
1. Goal/Objective and Business Understanding:

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
4. Data preprocessing:
5. Model Development: 
6. Model Evaluation: 
7. Result Interpretation:
