# Time-series-forecasting-for-tunnel-traffic

## Steps of the project:
1. ### Goal/Objective and Business Understanding:
Tunnel Traffic is a time series describing the number of vehicles traveling through the Baregg Tunnel in Switzerland each day from November 2003 to November 2005. Here, I try to explore various components in the time series like trends and seasonality and predict on out of sample data using Linear Regression model.

2. Data Understanding: 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
4. Data preprocessing: In order to facilitate time series analysis, Pandas package has been used to transform the dataset accordingly. By setting the index to a date
column, the "Day" column has been parsed as a date type by using `parse_dates` when loading the data. 
5. Model Development: 
6. Model Evaluation: 
7. Results:
8. Result Interpretation:
